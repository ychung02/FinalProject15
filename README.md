<h2>Interactive Portfolio</h2>
<p>I would like to utilize creative techniques for my portfolio, making the website itself a place of experimentation.</p>

<h2>Small Procedures for Investigation</h2>
<p>by creating simple to complicated gestures online, i would like to experiment on various methods of expression.</p>

<h2>Contribution of Others</h2>
<p>Nowadays web layouts(screenshots of browers etc.) are coming into forms of physically published media. I would like to do the opposite by taking a physical media, the magazine, and placing it in the web environment and allowing it to be curated by the user. I would like to create a website where peoplpe can create their own magazines online. By creating several layouts and selctions panels of different styles for a magazine, people can "publish" their own storyboard. In some ways it would be a new type of blog, in a form of a magazine.</p>
<li>
<ul>-allowing pages to flip over</ul>
<ul>-having the characteristics of a real magazine (paper quality, print quality etc.)</ul>
</li>
